# Pokemon GO Streamlit app

The goal of this script is to provide an interactive way to explore the relationship between Pokemon types and their scores.

## Libraries
pandas: used to load and manipulate the Pokemon dataset
streamlit: used to create the app interface and display the filtered Pokemon dataset and scatterplot
plotly.express: used to create the scatterplot of Pokemon scores

## Description

The app allows the user to filter the Pokemon dataset by type using a sidebar radio button, which updates the displayed table and scatterplot. The scatterplot shows Pokemon scores by type, with each point representing a single Pokemon and colored by its secondary type.
